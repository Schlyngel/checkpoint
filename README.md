My own version control system (vcs)

## ...but why?
Why not?

## What can it do?
Not that much yet.

## Should you use it for your project?


### Short answer: Probably not.

### Long answer:

You *have* to keep in mind that this is a personal project, not tailored to any other project or use case. It's supposed to be a little tip-toe adventure into the world of C.

I *will* finish this sooner or later so that it has very basic vcs functionality and *could* be used in projects, but it's not supposed to replace Git or others and never will. That's fine tho, I can live with that :)

Also, it will probably not be maintained after it's finished. I will leave it open for contribution, but from my end I'll be leaving it alone (...unless I decide otherwise in the future).
